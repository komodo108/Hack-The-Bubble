General story:
- the player is a dragon trapped in a dungeon
- the main goal is to escape

"You come to on the cold ground, tired eyes cracking open to blurry stone and the taste of dust on your tongue.
Stale air fills your lungs as you heave yourself to your feet, slamming your wing into a nearby wall with a resounding
smack in an attempt to stretch.

You curse, feeling the ache in your bones. Flying for more than a few minutes would be difficult in this state.

You aren't sure what happened to you, but one thing was clear: you need to get out of here, and fast. Something in the
air seemed to grow progressively more oppressive the longer you remained.

Then suddenly, something changed.

What was that?

You inhale.

A whiff of fresh air?

It was only a trace, but that was enough. There must be an exit here somewhere..."

Start of lvl 2:

"Too simple. Too easy. You aren't out of the woods yet.

Fire greets you from a pit below, but once again a trace of fresh air manages to
sneak its way through to you.

You must continue."

Start of lvl 3:

"More fire, more oxygen. Surely you must be getting closer."
